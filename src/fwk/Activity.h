/**
 * Activity interface for coordinating object interactions.
 *
 * An activity has three attributes:
 *
 *     status -- current status of the activity, e.g., idle or running
 *
 *     nextTime -- next time the activity should run
 *
 *     manager -- the activity manager that manages this activity
 *
 *     main -- main element for the activity, which use the special
 *         onMain notification (defined in ActivityElement) that begins
 *         the logic for the activity. Setting the main attribute
 *         is a shortcut for having a special notifiee that receives
 *         the first status change or initial timer event and then bootstraps
 *         the activity before disconnecting itself.
 *
 *     immediateDeliveryFlag -- indicates whether notifications should be
 *         delivered immediately instead of being deferred
 *
 *     posting -- notification queue for this activity
